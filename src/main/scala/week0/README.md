**BinarySearch.scala.**

It implements a classic algorithm known as binary search and tests it for an application known as whitelist filtering.

**BinDistribution.scala.**
I'll do a function to obtain recursively the binomial coeffcients. It's in the Coursera course too.

I've supposed first element is (1,1).

**Matrix library.** 

I've used scala files from:

**Shuffle algorithms.** 
Let's do an exercise of different shuffle algorithms: algorithm p, "inside-out" algorithms and Sattolo's variant.

We'll use an implicit class to extend Scala Collections with these features.

Algorithm P.

Sattolo's.

Generates a unifomly distributed cycle of length N using Sattolo's algorithm.

**3SUM**

 Get all combinations of three numbers (a,b,c) from a given list such that a+b+c=0.
