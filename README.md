Algorithms in Scala.
Just for practicing porposes with Scala I'll try to rewrite all exercises from Algorithms courses in Coursera. I'll do some exercises from the original course at http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/.

Main principles I'll try to follow:
* No side effects methods. No "traditional" loop.
* Functions always return something, and as first-class citizen they may be higher-order ones.
* Inmutability everywhere.

**BinarySearch.scala.**
It implements a classic algorithm known as binary search and tests it for an application known as whitelist filtering.
